-- Dat601 - Milestone 2 review

Logical review:

Intro: 
This review is about project milestone 2 logical which unlike the conceptional database modelling provides quite a lot of specific information about the database and how it will be implemented with the end result being the creation of a rule set and data structures,

Project thoughts:
For this milestone similar to milestone 1 the group project that we need in class helped immensely not only get used to these techniques  but making sure the logical design has a sensible data structure. This project work helped me understand more of how to process a conceptional model in a logical model.
Similar to the conceptional database modelling the group work helped me understand how this sort of database development may operate in a professional setting. In both this milestone and the practice group project done in class the logical database modelling also worked well in catching any mistakes in entity and relation choices s done previously  in the milestone 1 conceptional model.
While making the while working on the logical database modelling for both this milestone and the practice group project the conceptional modelling helped a lot  because it is easy to understand and view entities and their relationships which helped a lot when it came to creating the relationships via keys in the logical model
Past experience:
With this milestone I think what helped me was my time in a previous database class this helped me because I was already aware and participated a bit in things like normalisation and making sure data is atomic.
My work in my Systems analysis and design and this milestone as well as the practice group project taught me about the importance of case tools. For example, a case tool for analysis like visual paradigm can be used to analysis business requirement documents to make sure that nothing is overlooked  which would be useful in a professional setting.
With the group practice project I think the case tools like management tools like word and Visio were vital and also would be vital in a professional setting not only because as a team we needed to collaborate and be able to make changes to a single object but also because in my opinion the logical database modelling compared to conceptional database modelling takes a lot more work and time and also revisions  making this case tool all the more important.
Class work:
The process  covered in class for this millstone include learning how to normalize (Properly organizing data tables)
Learning about chens foot notation and how to properly use it I.E where certain symbols can be used if conditions are met like only using a many crows’ foot if the connection on that side connected to that table has many in the relationship. With this the best practice that worked for me and most likely in a professional setting as well was to constantly refer to chens notation symbols and meanings sheets. It was also extremely helpful to view other examples in class of chens foot notation being used when I didn’t quite understand how a symbol full worked.
