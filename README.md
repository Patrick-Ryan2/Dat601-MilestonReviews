# Dat601-MilestonReview Milestone 1 review

Conceptional review:

Intro: 
This review is about project milestone 1 conceptional  with the development of a conceptual database model  which is a high level view of a database used to identify entities/tables and their connections for the initial foundation stage for the development of a database.

Project thoughts:
For milestone 1 which involved analysing the brief for the Spaces business and then figuring out the conceptional design for a database for spaces by creating a conceptional database design from a business albeit fictional it really helped me understand the importance of conceptional database modelling. 
Also with starting the next milestone the logical database design and analysis this milestone helped me understand how each of the designs can be used as reference points to go back to this will help not only transfer the conceptional database modelling to logical database modelling but also help spot any errors as the clear diagrams make mistakes easier to stop then if they were in a purely written/form.
it was interesting working with chens notation while designing my database and making sure it was logical chens notation and using Visio did help make it quite clear when there were mistakes

Past experience:
I think that the practice project that we previously did working on a conceptional, and logical data base design helped a lot. Especially with the conceptional part of that group project because it was handy practice for figuring out sensible conceptional models  and also it was good practice and gave a preview of how group collaboration on database systems would operate in the professional world.
Along with this preview it game me insight into how exactly a similar project may operate in a professional setting like for example my group used shared Visio files a lot of the time but we also drew quite a lot on paper for rough sketches during brain storming sessions.

Class work:
During class sessions we learnt all about conceptional modelling and how to do it one thing I found difficult at first was the pitfall of making certain mistakes sometimes. For example, in some practice sketches I found it difficult to realize what was wrong with them or sometimes if they were properly normalized (Properly organized data tables) i eventually got better with continued practice.

Project work:
For milestone 1 conceptional and what was learnt during class sessions .First the business rules of the fictional were identified , refined and analysis this was done from the business brief which included requirements. 
From my time in my systems Development classes if found that visual paradigm can be a really useful tool for reviewing and easily identifying important information which may otherwise be overlooked if the developer  was not using a document analysing tool like visual paradigm or a similar software or  technique. 
Then the entities and relationships were identified both continuously going through material provided in class which showed  how to distinguish if a relationship between entities makes sense/works.
And then a the end of this the proposed conceptional database model was then presented to the tutor (Stakeholder) to gain feedback
